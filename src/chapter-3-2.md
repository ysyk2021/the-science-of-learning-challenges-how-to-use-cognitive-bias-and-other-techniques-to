By seeking out support, individuals can overcome obstacles and achieve their learning goals.

Cultivating Curiosity and a Love of Learning

Cultivating curiosity and a love of learning is another technique for developing a growth mindset. Individuals with a growth mindset are curious about the world around them and have a passion for learning new things. By cultivating curiosity and a love of learning, individuals can maintain motivation and enthusiasm for learning even when faced with challenges.
